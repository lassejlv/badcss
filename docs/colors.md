## Custom Colors

You can now use your own colors ðŸ¥¹. Here is an quick example

```html
<body
  badcss-config='{   
    "theme": {
      "colors": [{
        "name": "purple",
        "value": "#7734eb"
      }]
    }
  }'
>
  <!-- Your content.... -->
</body>
```

The color will automatically be added to the :root element, and you can use it like this:

```css
.badcss {
  color: var(--purple);
}
```
