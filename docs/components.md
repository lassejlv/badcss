# Using Components

In this guide we will teach you the basics of how our framework handles components. Quick note, we use the term "component" to refer to the HTML tag that is used to create the element. For example, `<themostbad component="button">` would create a button component.

## Creating a Component

To create a component, you will need to use the following syntax:

```html
<themostbad component="button"> Hello World! </themostbad>
```

Read about the `button` component [here](/docs/components/button).
